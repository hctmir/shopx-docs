# ✨ What are Customizations?

Customizations are what make ShopX truly *shine*! 🌟 They’re the secret sauce that turns your templates into dynamic, interactive experiences—giving you total control over variables, styles, and assets.

With ShopX, you can supercharge your projects using different types of customizations:
- 🎨 **Style Overrides**
- 🧮 **Variable Overrides**
- 🖼️ **Image Overrides**
- ✂️ **Image Cropping Overrides**

To make these changes on the fly, ShopX gives you a bunch of flexible input types:
- 📝 Text Input
- 🖼️ Image Picker
- 🔊 Audio Picker
- 🎬 Video Picker
- 🔽 Dropdown Select
- 🔛 Toggle Input
- 🎚️ Slider Input

And to keep things organized (and user-friendly!), you can present these inputs in cool ways:
- 💬 **Messages:** Show helpful tips or instructions for users.
- 📦 **Groups:** Nest related customizations together for easy access.

Don’t forget about **merge tags**—they’re key for controlling images and unlocking even more customization power. We’ll dive deeper into all this in the sections ahead!
