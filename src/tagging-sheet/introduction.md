# Introduction

## 🧾 What is the Tagging Sheet?

The **Tagging Sheet** is a centralized reference document used to organize and manage creative assets for point-of-sale (POS) execution. It typically exists as an Excel file and contains all the key details related to:

- 📍 Channel structure and localization  
- 🧱 POSM types and dimensions  
- 🛍️ Product and SKU details  
- 🎨 Design file references  
- 📜 Legal and promotional content

It ensures that all teams — creative, localization, marketing, and production — work with the same aligned source of truth.
