# New CCE Version

## 🆕 Why a New Version?

As our creative operations expand to support multiple clients and regions, the current **Tagging Sheet** format can feel too Coca-Cola–specific — especially when it comes to translations, brand names, and rigid sub-channel structures.

The new **CCE Version** is a simplified, modular structure that captures only the *essential fields* needed to manage creative assets efficiently, while remaining flexible for any brand, language, or market.
