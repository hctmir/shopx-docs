# 🚀 What are Layers?

At ShopX, **Layers** are your creative playground! 🎨 They’re the building blocks that let you organize and stack all kinds of elements on your template—just how you want them. Flexibility for every design dream!

In web dev lingo, layers are basically `html` tags that wrap up your content, images, buttons, and more. Simple, but powerful. 💪

## 🌟 Layer Lineup: The Essentials

Here’s what you can build with ShopX Layers (and their HTML twins):

- **Text** 📝: `<div>` holding your words.
- **Smart Text** 🤖: `<div>` with extra styling magic & dynamic features.
- **Image** 🖼️: `<img>` to show off your pics.
- **Button** 🔘: For now, just a `<div>`, but ready for action!
- **Shape** 🟦: `<svg>` shapes picked from our menu.
- **Video** 🎬: `<video>` with controls for crop, sound, and timing.
- **Audio** 🎵: `<audio>` to drop in your tunes or effects.
- **HTML** 💻: `<div>` where you can paste custom HTML code.
- **Group** 📦: `<div>` that bundles other layers together.

## 🛠️ Base Layer Properties

Every Layer in ShopX comes packed with some core properties you can tweak right from the UI. These settings help you power up your designs, keep things organized, and make styling a breeze. Here’s what you get out of the box:

- **Label** 🏷️: The friendly name for your Layer—think of it as your way to spot it at a glance.
- **Classes** 🎨: CSS magic starts here! Use classes to style your layer however you want. By default, we’ll turn your Label into a class (all lowercase, spaces become dashes). Want more? Add as many classes as you like—just separate them with commas!
- **Enable Interactivity** 🕹️: Flip this switch to make your layer draggable, resizable, stylable, or lock it inside its parent container. Total control, zero hassle.
- **Timing** ⏱️: Perfect for video exports! Set when your element appears in the timeline—timing is everything.
- **Visibility Conditions** 👀: Toggle logic rules to show or hide your layer based on variables or custom logic. Dynamic content, made easy!
- **Advanced CSS** 💅: Drop in custom styles directly onto your layer with inline `style=""` attributes. Get fancy!
