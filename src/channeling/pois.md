# POIs: Your In-Store Hotspots üìçüî•

## :book: Definition
A **POI (Point of Interest)** = A specific in-store location or asset grouping where your visual tools will be deployed (think: Main Shelf, Rack, Table Tent Card).

## How They Work
- Add one or more POIs per channel/sub-channel.
- Each POI auto-loads relevant POSM (Point of Sale Materials), like header cards, price tags, wobblers, etc.
- Customize each POI for brand, meal type, packaging, promo info, and more.

## Customization Power :zap:
- Dynamic size adjustments (within 20% of original design)
- Brand/logo swaps
- Meal type/micro moment tweaks
- Product SKU/packaging changes
- Upload custom images (QR codes, soon: food shots!)
- Promo message edits (where available)
